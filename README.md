## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive ROI-based performance analysis of Influencer Marketing campaigns conducted entirely in Microsoft Excel.

The objective of the project was not limited to visualization. It was designed as a structured analytical workflow covering:

Data Entry → Data Cleaning → KPI Modeling → Performance Analysis → Visualization → Strategic Recommendations

The analysis evaluates campaign effectiveness across multiple categories and platforms by measuring sales performance, engagement efficiency, reach optimization, and return on investment indicators.

The final output includes analytical dashboards, pivot-based reports, KPI modeling, and category-level strategic insights.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Before analysis, a structured cleaning and optimization process was applied.

### Implemented Data Preparation Steps:

- Standardized column names
- Adjusted cell formatting and alignment
- Cleaned unnecessary text in the “Campaign ID” column
- Logically filled empty Campaign ID cells
- Standardized “Start Date” and “End Date” into a unified date format
- Converted “Product Sale” into a consistent currency format
- Verified all column data types
- Applied dataset-wide filters
- Removed detected duplicate records
- Performed accessibility checks using Excel’s Check Accessibility feature

### Handling Missing Values

Missing values in the **Campaign Duration Days** column were calculated and filled using the difference between “Start Date” and “End Date”.

This ensured chronological consistency and preserved analytical integrity without removing records.

## 📊 KPI Modeling & Calculated Metrics

To enrich the analysis, additional calculated columns were created:

- **Engagement Rate**
- **Sales Per 1000 Reach**
- **Engagement Per Day**

These metrics enabled deeper evaluation of:

- Platform efficiency
- Category-level performance
- Conversion effectiveness
- Campaign productivity over time
